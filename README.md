# ðŸš¤ Yao's Millionaire's Problem (Yacht Edition)
Alice, Bob, and Eve are millionaires who want to figure out who's the richest without revealing their wealth to each other or anyone else.

Watch the demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Nq3isZTK1gA?si=1bnN5_MZADi9a38Z).

## **Local Setup**

```bash
https://github.com/ayush-that/inco-assignment.git
cd inco-assignment/
```

Make sure you have [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/cli/install) installed.

```bash
cd contracts
bun install
forge build # builds the smart contract
forge test # to run tests
```

In `MillionaireDilemma.s.sol`, you have to update `address alice`, `address bob`, `address eve` with their actual addresses before deploying the smart contract.

```
cd ..
cp .env.example .env
```

Set these environment variables
```
DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=v3-33-gc708d2f
ALICE_PRIV_KEY=
BOB_PRIV_KEY=
EVE_PRIV_KEY=
```

Now make sure Docker is running, we can start the entire app with a single command.

```
sudo chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## **Running e2e Tests**

In the backend folder, you have to set the following environment variables -

```
ALICE_PRIV_KEY=
BOB_PRIV_KEY=
EVE_PRIV_KEY=
ALICE_WEALTH=
BOB_WEALTH=
EVE_WEALTH=
```

After this, you can run the `millionaire.local.e2e.test.ts` with the following commands -

```bash
cd backend
bun install
bun test
```
